This is a simple CRUD phonebook app in the form of RESTApi + SPA(Single page application) <br />
This repository is for frontend, backend is visibile here: https://github.com/Kristian383/contact-app-backend

Application description:
Phonebook with the functions of entering, viewing, editing and deleting contacts containing name, surname, email and telephone number.

Tech: 
- database -> SQLAlchemy
- REST API -> Python Flask
- Frontend -> React + Redux + SCSS    (i also built the same app on frontend with Vue -> https://github.com/Kristian383/contact-app)
